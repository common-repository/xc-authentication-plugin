== Description ==
Thanks for installating XC Authentication plugin.
It also comes with "XCA Widget" since some themes will not show "XC Authentication" plugin..

XCA from www.ntx-research.com is a strong authentication plugin to secure users access to 
Wordpress blogs or sites.

It allows users to login their wordpress secure area without worrying about static password security issues.

Our strong authentication server will perform the authentication phase and allow entering in WP with full security.

For example, it combines very well with "Role Scoper" rights management plugin.
